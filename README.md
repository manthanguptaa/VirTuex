# VirTuex
Virtual Trial Room
## Introduction
VirTuex is an application that is used by people to help them try on clothes virtually they wish to buy.  It helps people to make a sure assumption about how they will look into the clothes they wish to buy on any online shopping portal just by the help of their daily drivers like laptop or mobile phones. Whenever people want to try the clothes they can go to the application, select the clothes and magically they are wearing those clothes (virtually). The clothes get superimposed on the appropriate part of the body of the user into their device’s screen just by using the built-in device camera. The user does not require any external hardware and they can use it by a tap/click on their screen.
